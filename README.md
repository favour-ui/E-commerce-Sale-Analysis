### Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from an e-commerce platform over a specified period (January 1, 2019 – March 19, 2019). The goal is to understand performance in terms of income, product demand, sales channels, and customer behavior. The insights are intended to guide strategic decisions for enhancing sales and customer engagement.
### Data Sources
The primary data source appears to be "E-commerce sales records.csv" from an e-commerce platform. This includes data fields such as:
- Product category
- Order quantity
- Gross and net income
- Customer type
- Payment method
- Date and time of transaction
- Gender
- City and branch
### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Mysql Workbench _ Data Cleaning and Data Analysis
- PowerBi - Data visualization and dashboard creation
### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we perform the following tasks
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing data
3. Making product names, dates, and customer types consistent
4. Data cleaning and formatting
### Expository Data Analysis
Expository Data Analysis (EDA) – Key Questions Explored

- What is the total income generated during the period?
- How much gross income was made after expenses?
- What is the total quantity of items sold?
- How many orders were placed?
- What is the average unit price across all products?
- What is the gross margin income?
- Which products had the highest and lowest sales (by quantity and revenue)?
- Which month recorded the highest sales?
- At what time of day do most sales occur?
- Who contributes more to sales: Members or Normal customers?
- Which branch or city generated the highest income and sales volume?
- Is there a difference in income generated by gender?

### Data Analysis

```

### Results/Findings

The analysis are summarised as follow:

1. January is the most profitable month, implying strong seasonality effects.
2. Afternoons are peak sales times—marketing and promotions should be aligned accordingly.
3. Normal customers contribute slightly more than members, suggesting customer loyalty programs may need review.
4. Branch C is the top performer in revenue, even though Mandalay sold the most units—possibly indicating higher value transactions in Branch C.
5. Electronics and Food & Beverages are high in demand but income doesn't necessarily correlate with quantity, hinting at price variation.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis conducted, we recommend the following actions to improve sales performance:

- Focus on Afternoon Sales: Most purchases happen in the afternoon, so run ads and offers during that time.
-  Boost Low-Selling Categories: Promote products like Health and Beauty to increase their sales.
- Invest More in Top Cities: Naypyitaw and Mandalay perform well—more marketing there could boost sales.
- Improve the Membership Program: Make the loyalty program more attractive to increase member purchases.
- Target Female Customers: Since they spend more, use tailored ads or product suggestions for them.

### Limitation
The analysis is based on a ~2.5-month window, which may not reflect annual trends.
